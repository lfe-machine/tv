This ex11 will be tailored to fit Raspberry Pi. Sometimes you don't need a full fledged window manager when you just want to display a sensor value or a couple of push buttons and a slider on a 5" screen.

To help create new widgets there is a small program in util to convert DXF-files to erlang ex11 drawing primitives. Draw your graphics in a CAD system and save as DXF. Convert the DXF file with dxf2erl:start("clock.dxf"). from the erlang console. There is a sample DXF file in util as well as a demo widget made up from the clock.dxf file.

The DXF file can be created in QCAD (free) http://www.ribbonsoft.com/en/ , AUTOCAD and other CAD systems. Entities with higher thickness will be drawn last. Closed polylines will be filled areas.


Install with a fresh Raspbian Jessie Light: (If you already have xserver and erlang installed, skip those steps).
# Erlang
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install wget

Compile util with:
erlc -I ../lib *.erl

Start util with:
erl -noshell -pa '../lib' -s clock init
