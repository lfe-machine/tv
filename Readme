## ex11 - A x11 programming lib for erlang without xlib or xcb.

X11 is GUI protocol for unix or unix-like machine. xlib and xcb are library for communicate to Xserver. Nowaday we use GTK/QT or something other lib make our beautiful and helpful GUI program. However, those lib based on xlib or xcb. When we develop a x program with erlang if no one porting your lovely GUI library, you should do this yourself. Porting is a big problem.

Joe Armstrong and his friend develop ex11 make GUI programming easy in erlang. Easy that's most important in ex11. You can see http://www.erlang.se/workshop/2004/ex11.pdf for intro.


# Note!

You don't need other lib with ex11 if you use Erlang/OTP above 19.0. If your version smaller than 19.0, please install addition lib make erlang can use unix domain socket or run x server in normal socket. See doc for more infomation.
