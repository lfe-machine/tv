1) Add suport for the Render extension (alpha channel etc).

2) Done, thanks to erlin. #Add a beter unixdom that can work with Ubuntu XMir (Xmir don't allow port 6000 comms).

3) Add smart widgets for embedded systems.

Old Widgets:

   1) Make resizing work in swEmaces and
      put the changes into swSelect

   2) Change the entry code to use swEmacs

   3) Change the textdisplay widget code to use
      emacs

   4) Fix this bug (ie stuff below me)

   Visual:

    To write Visual Erlang all you need is a few buttons
    to move things around.

    What you see here is the start of a simple layout program.

    Volunteers are needed to extend this into a Visual programming
    tool.


  The following problems need solving:

  1) Closing down the server

     How do I kill and window and close down the connection in an
     orderly manner.

  2) Keyboard mapping is hard coded  - I need code to get the key and sym
     tables from the server and then apply them dynamically

  3) How do I communicate with the window manager?

  4) We to write lots more widgets and "mega widgets"

  5) How about some proper "look and feel" - My 3D shading of
     buttons is very primitive

  6) Support for more fonts.

     9x15 is hard coded in almost everywhere

  7) Support for varaible width fonts

  8) Make a visual erlang - see the demo code

   If you feel you can make progress on any of these problems please contact
    me or mail the Erlang list.
